	|         OneLoneCoder Pixel Game Engine Extension            |
	|                Camera2D - v1.0				          |
	+-------------------------------------------------------------+

	What is this?
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	This is an extension to the olcPixelGameEngine v2.0 and above.
	It is quite simply, a 2D camera with smooth scrolling (lerping)
	capabilities.

	It needs to be initialised with a position and view size (usually
	set to the application screen width and height).

			olcPGEX_Camera2D camera;
			camera.InitialiseCamera(playerPos, screenRes);

	If you want smooth movement and boundary clipping you can lerp the
	camera like shown below.  This example assumes you are moving towards
	the players current position and centering the camera on the player.

			camera.vecCamPos = camera.LerpCamera(camera.ClampVector({ 0, 0 }, vecMapSize, (player.vecPos - camera.vecCamViewSize / 2.0f)), 15.0f);

	... and should be followed by a final clamp.

			camera.ClampCamera({ 0, 0 }, vecMapSize);


	This allows for decent camera tracking with relatively little
	setup and upkeep...
