	|         OneLoneCoder Pixel Game Engine Extension            |
	|                ResourceManager - v1.0				          |
	+-------------------------------------------------------------+

	What is this?
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	This is an extension to the olcPixelGameEngine v2.0 and above.
	Its features are simple... You supply a filename to load, and 
	the resource manager will only load the file if it has not
	already been loaded.

	It was designed to be used with decals in PGE_v2xx, however the
	Sprite info can be accessed via the decal->sprite method already
	avaialable in PGE...

	You generally create one instance of the resource manager in your
	main class and then pass it by reference into any class other than
	your main class that may need to load sprites or decals.

	It has only one function - RM_Sprite() which serves to both load
	the sprite file, or simply return a reference to it when needed.

	It has no "garbage collection" so be wary of using it in loops.
	Any sprites or decals loaded with this extention under normal usage
	will be destroyed upon application exit in most operating systems.
